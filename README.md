https://users.multimediatechnology.at/~fhs51397/rock-paper-scissors/

A simple command-line implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, where you play against the computer. This project is part of the The Odin Project curriculum.

How it Works:
The computer makes its choice randomly between 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors'.
The player can input their choice through the console.
The game then evaluates the choices and declares the winner for each round.
The game consists of five rounds, and at the end, it will display the overall winner or loser.
